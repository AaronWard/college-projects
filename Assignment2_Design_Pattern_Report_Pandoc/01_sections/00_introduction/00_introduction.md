# Introduction
The aims of this report is to highlight and explain the design and development of software using four object oriented design patterns. This project consists of a cake maker shop program written in java that can register users, store credentials in a database, allow users to make cakes, view registered users and retrieve their information. Initially the system requirements and specifications needed will be discussed to describe the functional goals of the program. This is followed by a section on system design, which will explain the design choices that have been considered and implemented. Furthermore, a section on the implementation is provided in order to explain the chosen design patterns and snippets of code in the program used to attain the goal of the project. Lastly, a conclusion section is given clarifying the achievements of the project and also further work that may be carried out.
