# Conclusions and Further Work

## Conclusion

To conclude, the project was successful in implementation. The system utilises four object oriented design patterns as stated in the specification. The Singleton pattern enforced the rule of only one user to be allowed log into the system at any one time. An Abstract Factory was used for creating new panel objects and updating the graphical user interface when needed. Cake objects where dynamically created using the Builder pattern, specific to each user. A Composite pattern aided in the grouping of users for each county they have registered for and lastly, database implementation was successful and used suitably to apply persistent storage of data. Furthermore, the program was provided with a smooth and easy to user graphical user interface that allows ease of use to a user. With the utilisation of inuitive design choices a user may be able to use the program with instruction. Therefore, in conclusion, the program succeeded and met the requirements for the deliverables needed.


## Furtherwork
Should the chance of designing and creating this application arose again, it would be highly considered to apply more detailed GUI components to the view. A user could choose upload a display photo when their account when registering and be displayed in the "View Users" page. Furthermore, it is desirable that more counties for regristration to given. As it is unrealistic in a real world application for a program to only allow three counties, it might be more suitable to allow all counties or even countries choices to be implemented.
