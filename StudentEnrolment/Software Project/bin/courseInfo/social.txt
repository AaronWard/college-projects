For the duration of their course at ITB, 
students will study a wide and interesting 
variety of subjects across social care practice, 
psychology, sociology, and creative studies 
along with other subjects related to social 
care such as law, group working, health 
studies and inter cultural studies.
While on campus students can avail of our 
specially adapted social care training rooms 
where role-plays and interactive learning 
take place. 

All students attend prearranged 
placements in a social care setting enabling 
them to apply their academic knowledge to a 
working environment while developing their skills 
as a competent and innovative social care worker.
In ITB many of our team of lecturers have years 
of frontline experience as social care workers. 
In addition our lecturers in psychology and 
sociology are highly qualified in their 
discipline.
