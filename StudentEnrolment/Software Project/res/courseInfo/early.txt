The programme combines theory with hands-on 
experience and practical skills. 
Students experience the variety of the early 
years sector through placements in two 
distinct settings providing the opportunity 
to link classroom learning with work based 
practice. 

Students are supervised throughout 
placement by an experienced early years practitioner 
as well as being given ongoing support from 
an allocated college academic supervisor.
