This branch of engineering deals with the research,
design, test , manufacture and maintenance of modern
electronics systems, which typically consist 
of electronics under the control of software.

As the technology sector in Ireland continues to grow,
there is a demand for graduates who have a blend 
of hardware and software knowledge and skills.
Hardware deals with the electronics and structure
of computer based products and software deals with
how they are programmed to perform useful tasks. 
In many cases people working in these areas have
graduated from courses where either software or 
hardware was the major component.
Computer Engineering provides a 
more suitable base by providing the graduate 
with theory and skills in hardware and software, 
as well as giving the student an overview of the 
architecture of computer based systems. 
Courses in this area build the students' 
competencies from basic electronics to microprocessors; 
embedding computers into products and developing 
software drivers to make them work.
